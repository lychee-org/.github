# Lychee: An Enhanced Chess Puzzle Trainer

Lychee is a free and open-source intelligent chess trainer that helps people improve their chess training.

Borrowing from, but not entirely copying, spaced repetition techniques, the software attempts to do the following:
1. Practicing tactics that you are weaker at with a higher frequency using a modified version of the SM-2 algorithm found in Anki and other apps
2. Repetition of similar puzzles from puzzles that you have previously gotten incorrect using a modified version of the Leitner system as well as a novel similarity algorithm

All of this is wrapped in a free-to-use web service complete with user progress visualisation, presently hosted at https://lychee-omega.vercel.app/ *(to be changed before full public release)*
